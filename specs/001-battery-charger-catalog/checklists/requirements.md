# Specification Quality Checklist: Battery Charger Product Catalog

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../../specs/001-battery-charger-catalog/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass (initial validation, 2026-08-09).
- SC-007 references the 21st.dev MCP server, which is a constitution-mandated
  project policy rather than an implementation detail; retained as a
  business-level requirement.
- Assumptions section documents image sourcing (hotlinked source CDN URLs),
  PKR currency, no fabricated ratings, demo-scope storefront, client-side
  persistence, and research-time data accuracy.
- Ready for `/sp.plan`. No `/sp.clarify` needed.
